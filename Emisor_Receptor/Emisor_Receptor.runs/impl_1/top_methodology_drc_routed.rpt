2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell leds_reg[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) leds_reg[0]/CLR, leds_reg[1]/CLR, leds_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch leds_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin leds_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch leds_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin leds_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch leds_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin leds_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
